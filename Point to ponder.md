 If N is a perfect square, then it has an odd number of factors.
 
 Subarray question

 Hashing

* >> right shift by one is same as divided by 2.

* << left shift by one is same as multiply by 2.


* Masking is done to check the number is even or odd. If the last bit is 1 = odd and if last bit is 0 = even.

#### If need to swap two number-
    * use XOR (^) operator.
    * int A = A ^ B;
    * int B = A ^ B;
    * int A = A ^ B;
