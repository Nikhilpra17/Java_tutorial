- Scanner usage in java:
    - Assign it differently for the different data type otherwise it would not capture the data after space.

 - If N is a perfect square, then it has an odd number of factors. 
 
 Subarray question
 Hashing
* >> right shift by one is same as divided by 2.

* << left shift by one is same as multiply by 2.


* Masking is done to check the number is even or odd. If the last bit is 1 = odd and if last bit is 0 = even.
    * to do this -   (A & 1 == 0) //Even

#### If need to swap two number-
    * use XOR (^) operator.
    * int A = A ^ B;
    * int B = A ^ B;
    * int A = A ^ B;
    
##### To find set bit in an number - n & (n-1)
    
#### To find the only non repeating element in an array we can use XOR.

- ***Convert String to char Array = str.toCharArray();
